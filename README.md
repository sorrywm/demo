A demo repo for learning github

This is a repo for testing out things in github. Here are a few useful resources for using github.

Github guides has a basic activity for working with repos, [hello-world](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/).

The guide above shows how to contribute to a repo using the github website. You may also want to be able to edit and add files right from your own computer. First, you will want to [install](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) and [set up git](https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git/). Then, for working with the repo, you will either want to:

1) Use [Github Desktop](https://help.github.com/desktop/guides/contributing-to-projects/).
2) Use the command line. Here are a couple of resources for [adding a new repository](https://help.github.com/articles/adding-an-existing-project-to-github-using-the-command-line/) and [adding a file to a repository](https://help.github.com/articles/adding-a-file-to-a-repository-using-the-command-line/) using the command line. One user has also set up a [cheat sheet](https://gist.github.com/davfre/8313299) of command line commands to use with github. 

[Karl Broman](http://kbroman.org/), the creator of several widely used packages for QTL analysis, has made a supposedly minimal tutorial, his [git/github guide](http://kbroman.org/github_tutorial/), that shows how to do a variety of tasks in github.

For later stages in the game, his page on [Putting your R package on github](http://kbroman.org/pkg_primer/pages/github.html) may also be helpful.

Appropos of nothing, I just found that github supports [large file storage](https://git-lfs.github.com/?utm_source=github_site&utm_medium=blog&utm_campaign=gitlfs). If you want to add large data files to your repo, you should probably install this first.
